        Fedora 20 brings the latest version of the new GNOME 3 desktop interface to your system. The release, like the 3.8 release, brings more improvements and a bunch of new applications: Application installer, GNOME maps, GNOME photos, GNOME music, and the Bijiben note taker. The release continues GNOME 3's road towards a better integrated desktop environment.
